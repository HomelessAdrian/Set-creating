This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to create a new folder inside the current project with three pre-defined files:

- A `.jsx` file, which contains a basic JSX template.
- A `.css` file (empty).
- An `index.js` file that imports the `.jsx` file and exports the JSX content.

The extension is designed to help streamline the creation of components and styles with minimal setup.

## Features

- **Create Folder**: When you create a new folder, the extension will prompt you for a folder name.
- **Pre-defined Files**: The extension will automatically generate:
  - `<folderName>.jsx` file with a basic JSX template.
  - `<folderName>.css` file (empty).
  - `index.js` file that imports both `.jsx` and `.css` files and exports the `.jsx` component.
- **Quick Setup**: Simplifies the process of creating a folder structure with initial files.
